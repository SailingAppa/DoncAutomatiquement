/*SOS Blink, very first project of Cl√©ment Leroy, Boat Captain.
 * I'll basicaly just adapt the basic code "Blink" of arduino
 * SOS : three short, three long, three short
 * International Morse Code
 * 1 dash = 3 dots
 * The space between parts of the same letter = 1 dot
 * The space between letters = 3 dots
 * The space between words = 7 dots
 * SOS : ...---...
 * three dots, three dashes, three dots
 * 
 * In this code one dot = one second
 *
